# Project Description

This project was used for the Online Conference & Exhibition held by Seoul Tourism Organization(STO) and Union of International Associations(UIA). Due to the Pandemic, They couldn't host the annual event that they had been organised for decades. Therefore, they needed us to build a website, Virtual Seoul, as a substitute for their offline Conference and Exhibition.

Our team consisted of

- A Project Manager
- A front-end developer
- Two back-end developer,
- Two Web designer
- Two WebGL developer

My responsibility was developing both front-end and back-end. Particularly, I developed the front-end entirely on my own from scratch.

# Result of project

### STO is very happy with this application.

STO was very satisfied with this application. They even asked us to do more projects for them.

### This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library

During the development, I realised building a crontab (scheduling jobs) is quite tedious and difficult to test. This motivated me to create a node open-source package, which allows you to easily build a crontab functionality. [Link To My Crontab library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab). I created this package entirely on my own from scratch. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.

### Our application has received great attention in the market

Our application, Virtual Seoul, has received great attention in the market and attracted many professional event organizers. As a result, It brought many contracts.

#### Some of the biggest projects I've built are listed below.

- KHA ( Korean Hospital Association )
- Asia TEFL (Teaching English as a second or foreign language)
