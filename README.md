# Achievement

### 1. This project has brought over 10 additional contracts.

#### [Reference] - Some of the biggest projects I've built are listed below.


- [KHA Online Conference](https://khc2020.salin.co.kr) ( Korean Hospital Association ) can be logged in with ID: host01@salin.co.kr PW: 1234
- [Simens Online Conference](https://siemens-evavconference.govent.io) can be logged in with ID: abc@abc.com PW: 1234
- Asia TEFL Online Conference (Teaching English as a second or foreign language)

### 2. Created reusable components and APIs.

During the development, we created several reusable components and APIs. This allowed us to save time and make greater profits.

#### [Reference] - Reusable radio input component on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/radio-3mtce?file=/src/App.jsx).

### 3. This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library

#### [Reference] - [Link To My Crontab library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)
[![demo photo](assets/crontab.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)

I realised building a crontab (scheduling jobs) is quite tedious and difficult to test. I knew such a function will be used many times in our projects and I wouldn't want to repeat the same implementation over and over again. This motivated me to modularise this functionality. And one thing led to another, I ended up creating a node open-source package out of it. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.

### 4. Learned how to optimize React app performance.

As the application grew, it started getting too much re-render and slowed the app down. Particularly, I was surprised when HTML auto-canvasing functionality no longer worked after adding several logics to it. In the debugging and optimizing process, I learned about several methods such as React.memo, HOC, React.useCallback, lazyload, algorithms and so on.    

# Note 

Due to the company policy, I am unable to open the source code.
