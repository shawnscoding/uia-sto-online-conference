### This application feels like a real event and offers almost all features that offline events do.

# Achievement

### This project has brought many contracts.

Our application, Virtual Seoul, has received great attention in the market, which brought many contracts.

#### Some of the biggest projects I've built are listed below.

- KHA Online Conference ( Korean Hospital Association )
- Asia TEFL Online Conference (Teaching English as a second or foreign language)
- Simens Online Conference

### At the end of the project, we've already had tons of reusable component

After the development, we could find that we can reuse the components and APIs in other projects. This allowed us to save time and make more profits.

### This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library

During the development, I realised building a crontab (scheduling jobs) is quite tedious and difficult to test. This motivated me to create a node open-source package, which allows you to easily build a crontab functionality. [Link To My Crontab library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab). I created this package entirely on my own from scratch. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.

<!--

# Note

Due to the company policy, I am afraid that I am not allowed to open the source code. -->
